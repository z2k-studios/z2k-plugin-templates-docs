    "Purpose: Curated cross-links appended to the Intro sidebar (in addition to root docs).",
    "Why: Let the Intro surface important pages that live in other sections (e.g. Getting Started, Reference Manual) without reorganizing content.",
    "How it is used:",
    "  - The step3 sidebar generator reads this file (if present) after listing root-level docs.",
    "  - Each entry must be an object: { id: \"<docId>\", label: \"<display label>\" }",
    "  - The id must match the Docusaurus doc id produced by the indexing step (folder/subfolder/filename-without-ext).",
    "Notes:",
    "  - Optional file; if missing no cross-links are added.",
    "  - Keep this list short â€” think \"curated quick links\", not a second table-of-contents."
